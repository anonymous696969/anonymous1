<p class="zxc">  they have made seven separate appeals over the past two years for help in questioning President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, including letters to FBI Director James Comey and US Justice Department officials. Ukrainian officials said the US has not responded to those requests.

Under a "mutual legal assistance" treaty, the two countries have agreed to regularly assist each other in law enforcement efforts, such as gathering statements and other evidence for prosecutions.

US authorities confirmed to CNN that the requests were received but declined further comment. Manafort served as Trump's campaign chief until being pushed out in August 2016. The official requests from a special prosecution unit in Kiev started in December 2014, and involve a corruption case targeting Ukraine's former Justice Minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych. Manafort has not been charged with a crime. Prosecutors want him to testify, Ukraine's prosecutor for special investigations Serhiy Gorbatyuk said.

Prosecutors allege that Lavrynovych illegally diverted more than $1 million in government funds to a prominent New York City law firm — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Lavrynovych had hired Skadden to review the 2011 jailing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who had received a seven-year sentence for allegedly harming Ukraine's interests in gas supply negotiations with Russia. Tymoshenko was the main political rival of the Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort advised until Yanukovych was deposed in 2014. Tymoshenko was released from jail at the same time that Yanukovych was ousted. Many saw her sentencing as politically motivated by the pro-Russian government. In 2012, as a result of the sentencing, Ukraine faced the possibility of an unfavorable ruling from the European Court of Human Rights, and US lawmakers were considering sanctions. In response to the deteriorating international climate, Ukrainian prosecutors say, Manafort drafted a public relations strategy that included hiring Skadden to review the Tymoshenko case and show the conviction had a sound

<p class="qwe">By hindi makikila,	
<p class="asd"><font size="5px">The drug war not only threatens to slow down growth, but also qualifies as one of the most anti-poor policies in recent Philippine history.

<p class"asd">In recent years the government has committed to pursue “inclusive growth” as the overarching goal of Philippine development: economic growth that is not just rapid and sustained, but also broad-based and pro-poor.
However, inclusive growth is now under threat from President Duterte’s ruthless war on drugs, which has already led to more than 7,000 deaths (and counting).

In this article we argue that the drug war is not only anti-growth, but also overwhelmingly anti-poor. Therefore, the drug war thwarts our country’s pursuit of inclusive growth.



<p class="qwe"><font size="30px" color="black">Duterte prefers 'compromise' with tax evaders over filing cases</font>
<p class="qwe">By hindi makikila,	
<p class="asd"><font size="5px">President Rodrigo Duterte is still convincing Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III and BIR chief Cesar Dulay to let tax evaders settle with the government instead of filing cases against them
<p class"asd">MANILA, Philippines – For President Rodrigo Duterte, requiring big tax evaders to just settle with the government is much more practical than filing a case against them.

Duterte told Filipino-Chinese business groups in Pasay City on Friday, March 24, that he wants his administration to take the "compromise" approach in dealing with tax evaders, but he is yet to convince concerned government officials about this.

"Even those with evasion of taxes, the law allows a compromise. And I will allow compromises," he said.

Among the members of the audience were Tessie Sy-Coson and Lucio Tan, whose companies are among the country's biggest tax payers.

Duterte argued that the resolution of tax evasion cases takes too long, while settling with tax evaders would give the government much needed money for public services.



<p class="qwe"><font size="30px" color="black">Duterte to attend Belt and Road summit in China</font>
<p class="qwe">By hindi makikilala,	
<p class="asd"><font size="5px">The Philippine President's attendance to the Silk Road Initative summit in May will be his second visit to China
<p class"asd">MANILA, Philippines – For the second time, President Rodrigo Duterte will fly to China, this time to attend the One Belt, One Road Summit to be held in May.

Duterte himself announced his attendance to the summit on Friday, March 24.

"I'm going there, I was invited by the President himself, 'yung the One Belt, One Road. It's a very ambitious project of China," he said during the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc (FFCCCII) Biennial Convention in Pasay City.

The "One Belt, One Road" or Belt and Road Initiative refers to China's plan to revive the ancient silk road trading route that would link Asian markets with economic circles in Europe.

This "trade and infrastructure network" is seen as the center of China's "economic diplomacy" and is the brainchild of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The Philippines' participation in the initiative was announced and welcomed by China during Duterte's state visit last October 2016.

The summit is expected to take place from May 14 to 15, FFCCCII President Angel Ngu told Rappler. He is also attending the event.
